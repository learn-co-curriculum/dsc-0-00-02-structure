# Structure

In this short lesson, we'll provide an overview of the structure and time requirements for completing this course.

## Modules

The course is comprised of five modules (sometimes called mods - e.g. "we're working our way through mod 2 right now"). Each of the first four modules is primarily instructional, with a project at the end. The final module is focused on an individual project allowing you to bring together everything you've learned and to showcase what you can do with those skills.

Here are the modules, and what you'll be covering:
* Mod 1	Exploratory Data Analysis and Descriptive Statistics
* Mod 2	Advanced Data Retrieval and Analysis
* Mod 3	Models for Machine Learning
* Mod 4	Advanced Machine Learning / Deep Learning
* Mod 5	Final project

## Sections

The instructional content for the first four modules is broken out into a total of 48 sections. Each section is designed to be 8-10 hours of solid work (a long, full "day" of instruction). There are twelve sections in each of the first four modules.

Here are the first 24 sections of the course - we'll be uploading the others by the end of the year:

* Section 01 - Getting Started with Data Science
* Section 02 - Importing and Statistical Analysis of Data
* Section 03 - Working with Pandas
* Section 04 - Data Cleaning in Pandas
* Section 05 - SQL and Relational Databases
* Section 06 - Object Oriented Programming
* Section 07 - OOP Continued
* Section 08 - NumPy and Foundations of Probability and Combinatorics
* Section 09 - Statistical Distributions
* Section 10 - Introduction to Linear Regression
* Section 11 - Multiple Regression and Model Validation
* Section 12 - A Complete Data Science Project Using Multiple Regression
* Section 13 - Linear Algebra
* Section 14 - Calculus, Cost Function and Gradient Descent
* Section 15 - An Introduction to ORMs
* Section 16 - Working with JSON and XML
* Section 17 - Accessing Data through APIs
* Section 18 - HTML, CSS and Web Scraping
* Section 19 - Distributions and Sampling
* Section 20 - Hypothesis and AB testing
* Section 21 - Combinatorics part II and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
* Section 22 - Bayesian Classification
* Section 23 - Resampling and Monte Carlo Simulation
* Section 24 - Extensions to Linear Models

## Lessons

Each section is comprised of a number of lessons (typically 10-20 although a handful of the sections have closer to 25 shorter lessons). There are four types of lessons you'll come across:
* **Readme's** are lessons where your primary job will be to watch a video and/or read text. We typically use those to introduce new topics and concepts
* **Code alongs** are typically used to give you some hands on experience with a programming task, providing sample code and instructions so you can get used to writing code to solve the problem
* **Labs** require you to actually write novel code on your own. Most of them are "small motion" labs to let you practice a specific discrete skill
* **Projects** allow you to pull together a range of different skills that you've learned individually through readme's, code alongs and labs to solve a larger, more realistic data science problem. A good number of the sections have a "summative project" towards the end - pulling together the skills you've learned within the section

## End of Module Projects

At the end of each of the first four modules, there is a required, individual project. It's sometimes said that structured classes are "in project mode" while they're working on both the end of mod projects and the mod 5 project.

## Pace and Time Requirements

The same core curriculum is used for immersive, structured online and self-paced online programs.

### For Immersive Programs:
* This is a 15 week course
* Students often work 60+ hr weeks
* Each module takes 3 weeks to complete
* Each section should take a day to complete
* End of module projects should be completed in three, long days (typically ~40-50 hrs)
* The course will take 900-1000 hours of effort to complete

### For Full Time, Online Programs
* This is a 20 week course
* Students often work 50+ hr weeks
* Each module takes 4 weeks to complete
* Each section should take just over a day to complete (we deploy 4 sections a week)
* End of module projects should be completed in a week (typically ~50 hrs)
* The course will take ~1000 hours of effort to complete

### For Part Time, Online Programs
* This is a 40 week course
* Students often work 25+ hr weeks
* Each module takes 8 weeks to complete
* Each section should take just over a day to complete (we deploy 4 sections a week)
* End of module projects should be completed in two weeks week (typically ~50 hrs)
* The course will take ~1000 hours of effort to complete

### For Self Paced, Online Programs
* Each section should take just over a day to complete
* The course will take ~1000 hours of effort to complete

## A Note About Time Requirements
Most of our students are "exceptional". Choosing to invest in changing your career is not something that everyone does. Because of this, most of our students are used to doing things more quickly than "most people". Unfortunately, your peers aren't "most people". As such, you should assume that completing this course will require 1000 hours of focused effort. Please plan and schedule accordingly!
